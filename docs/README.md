Idea 1: Grocery List

    The web application's purpose is to create a grocery list based on budget and nearby grocery store prices. The user will input their budget and set their location.
The application will look into grocery stores nearby and look into their databases to look up prices of their products and create a grocery list based on recipes from 
a recipes database. From the recipe's ingredients, the prices of the ingredients will be searched up in the grocery store database and summed up to check if they are
within the budget set. The users will be able to follow the recipes from the app. The user logins to keep track of previous orders and can allow notifications on items
that they save that have the potential to on sale.
